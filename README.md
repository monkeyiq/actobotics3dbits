sfe-rotary-encoder-quadrature-holder-11102.scad
This is a part to hold the SFE rotary encoder quadrature encoder. It bolts
on to the channel and the side flanges bit around the edges of the channel.
Use M3 screws to secure. I used 10mm M3 screws.

I had to make some modifications with a dremel post print which are
listed in the 'problems'. Patches accepted :)

Problems found post print:
1) The bolt slots are not in the right place. I would recommend widening
   the bolt holds to be slots. 
2) The contour I added to strengthen the joint between where the encoder mounts
   and the base that bolts to the channel hits the encoder itself when you try to mount.
   I'd recommend hollowing out some of the center of the countour, or making the 
   encoder mount 4mm or so higher.
